- A combination-oriented game heavily inspired by Little Alchemy but WITH FOOD!
- This project is specializing in baking goods
- Maybe a shop where you get points from making food items, which you can use to buy new ingredients??

# Frontend
- Drag the 
- Tools: Oven, Stove, Knife, Rolling
- Default Ingredients: Flour, Sugar, Eggs, 

# Backend
- Store each user’s password and username
- Store each user’s # of recipes, and which ingredients they have on their 
- Store friendlist
- Allow transfer of ingredients between users via messages
- Store the recipe tree/the combinations you need for each food item
