INTERACTION BETWEEN PYTHON AND VSCODE:<br>
- Make a ripoff pokemon game with ASCII art by Thursday (implementing rng mechanics, element damage, maybe animations)<br>
- Use python random module in order for increased gambling addiction<br>
- add system where different elements do more damage in certain scenarios (all portions of the game ideally done by Thursday)<br>
- implement a win screen for extra dopamine<br>
INTERACTION BETWEEN JS AND VSCODE:<br>
- Weather api w/ JS by Thursday <br>
- Put weather data into html table<br>

- Change up the JQuery, personalize it<br>
INTERACTIO BETWEEN BASH AND VSCODE:<br>

MISC:<br>

Errors that we had:<br>
- We tried implementing a minigame as a fun way to change up the combat in the pokemon game<br>
- We tried using the python keyboard module but it didn't work, there were errors stating that it needed root access<br>
- Weekly log 3 wouldnt allow comments<br>
- Table sorting was horizontally instead of vertically, fixed by adding padding<br>
- API wasn't allowing pulling data, fixed by setting permissions on the website<br>
