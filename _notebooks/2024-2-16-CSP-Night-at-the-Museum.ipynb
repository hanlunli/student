    "Grows: I think we could have worked on trying to find more people to talk to, instead of focusing on just a couple of people\n",
    "Glows: I think we did a pretty good job explaining the elements of our project in a digestible way, and we also got some good suggestions in order to enhance the user's experience on our website. \n",

    "One of these things that we are going to add is a text box next to our items, in order to make the user finding the proper ingredients easier. \n",
